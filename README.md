## Usage
This website creates an easy-to-read personal todo list. Simply register with your name, email, and password and start adding tasks. When you're done with them, check them off.
### Application
This website is not a replacement for your digital calendar. It does not track the time of day, so it won't remind you to take a call at 9 am on Tuesday or go to the doctor at 1 pm on Saturday. Instead, it is a digital version of the paper todo list. It is ideal for tracking those things that you need or want to get done by a certain day, such as getting your oil change or buying a new pair of shoes.

The color code and layout make it easy to find your priorities. Tasks are listed from most to least urgent. Tasks within the next day appear in red, those within the next week appear in yellow, and everything else appears in green.
### Code
This website uses React for the frontend, NodeJS + Express for the server, and PostgreSQL for the database. Credentials are encrypted with bcrypt.
### What's next?
Push notifications and mobile app!

### Footnote
Please be patient if you need a few seconds to register or sign in. The backend is hosted for free on Heroku, and this creates a lag when the app goes dormant.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
